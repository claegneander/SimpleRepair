# SimpleRepair

SimpleRepair is a plugin that does a few simple things.


    All mobs, such as zombies, have a chance to drop a custom item called the Scroll of Repairing.
    Two commands are introduced, "/repair" and "/repair-all".

Customizable

You can turn off the scroll of repairing drop completely, or alter the drop rate for every single mob in the game within the config.yml.

In addition to this, you can allow or disallow mobs from mob spawners to drop the scroll of repairing. By default, this is off.


Permissions

Both of the commands have separate permission nodes that should work with any permission plugin.

    sr.commands.repair
    sr.commands.repair-all


Scroll of Repairing

Right click with the scroll, then right click with any damaged item to repair it completely. This will consume the scroll.
